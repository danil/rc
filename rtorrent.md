  used. For example: ~/torrent/*

  torrent has not yet been activated.

`^s` Start download. Runs hash first unless already done.

`^d` Stop an active download, or remove a stopped download.

`^k` Stop and close the files of an active download.

`^r` Initiate hash check of torrent. Without starting to download/upload.
